1. Setup of the classes and inheritance is good.

2. There is an empty if option on Line 68: 
if (selection.equals("Select Product")) {

If there is nothing inside an if block, then there is no need
for the block at all.

3. For the option to exit the application, consider using 
System.exit(1);

Like so:
if (choice.equals(MAIN_MENU_OPTION_EXIT)) {
	inventoryList.auditLog();
	System.exit(1);
}

4. your auditLog method in Inventory.java looks strange. Perhaps it's unfinished
functionality, for example you're hard coding a date of 2020-11-22. 

5. Change should be displayed in proper coinage, if you had time to implement this.
